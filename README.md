This repository contains two file associated with our machine-learning prediction of pristine and endohedral doped (O and Se) Ge12C12 and Si12C12 nanostructures as anode material in lithium-ion batteries.
The first file with 'xlsx' extension (Microsoft Excel) contains the dataset from our DFT simulated nanostructures used for machine learning prediction.
The second file with 'ipynb' extension (Jupyter Notebook) contains the machine learning code used to predict the nanostructures' cell voltage (Vcell) as anode material in lithium-ion batteries.
